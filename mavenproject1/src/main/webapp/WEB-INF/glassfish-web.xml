    Delegation
    - - - - - -

    The Java Servlet specification recommends that a web module's class loader
    look in the local class loader before delegating to its parent. You can make
    this class loader follow the delegation inversion model in the Servlet
    specification by setting delegate="false" in the class-loader element of the
    glassfish-web.xml file. It is safe to do this only for a web module that
    does not interact with any other modules. For details, see "class-loader" in
    GlassFish Server Open Source Edition Application Deployment Guide.

    ...

    For a number of packages, including java.* and javax.*, symbol resolution is
    always delegated to the parent class loader regardless of the delegate
    setting. This prevents applications from overriding core Java runtime
    classes or changing the API versions of specifications that are part of the
    Java EE platform.
